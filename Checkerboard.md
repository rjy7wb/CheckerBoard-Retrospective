### Reflect on the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

Overall I believe I accomplished the goals for this assignment, my checkerboard is completely functional.
It also follows the MVC design goals.

My CheckerBoard:  
  
-Allows the user to change the dimensions (fixed)  
-Allows the user to change the color (fixed)  
-scales when the user drags the window  
-follows the MVC guidelines  

### How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly?
I met all requirements, and functionality, I did have to learn to effectively read and understand documentation to implement this as I have never used ActionEvents.
### How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
when selecting board dimensions, I repeated code, instead of using a simple if/else or switch statement.
### How could you improve going foward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
I believe overall I understand MVC and why its important, I do believe I need more exposure to it to master it.
